**This is still a work in progress**

# Issues
Timing is broken

Sound is not implemented

Some games work relatively well right now, most are still broken to some extent.

# How to use

If you want to try running this emulator...

From the ``run.sh`` script help menu:
```
-c Compile Chip8 with make
-d Delete all build files (including executable) with make clean
-g Run in debug mode with gdb
-e Exit
-k Force kill CHIP8 
-y Compile with compiledb script for YCM syntax completion/checking
-t Run optest
-h This help menu
```
If you run this script without arguments, it will let you select a game and run the CHIP8 emulator. 
You must compile it with the -c flag first for it to work.

If you cannot use the ``run.sh`` script for whatever reason, you can compile the program with ``make``,
and then run it with ``./CHIP8 "games/IBM"``, to run the IBM test ROM for example.

The emulator has some flags that you can pass for certain features. These are all basically implemented to
make debugging easier. If you want to use them, see the chip8 help menu by running ``./CHIP8 -h``


To render the graphics, I am using SDL 2.0.
