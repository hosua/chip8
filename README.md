**This is still a work in progress**

To compile, either run the ``run.sh`` bash script, or use the ``make`` command.

Currently, the IBM test ROM, and the opcode test works! 

Lots of opcodes among other things are still broken/not implemented yet though. 

I also have not done graphics yet, I probably will use SDL to display them at some point, but I still need to learn how to do that. 

Right now, I'm just verifying the graphics work by printing them into the terminal.
