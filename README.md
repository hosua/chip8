**This is still a work in progress**

To compile, either run the ``run.sh`` bash script, or use the ``make`` command.

Currently, the IBM test ROM, and the opcode test works! 

Lots of opcodes among other things are still broken/not implemented yet though. 

To render the graphics, I am using SDL 2.0.
